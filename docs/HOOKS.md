## 1. session-start.sh

**Event:** `SessionStart`

### Problem

When a new Claude Code session starts, stale cache data from previous sessions may remain in `/tmp`. Over time, these accumulate and waste disk space. Additionally, Claude Code often re-queries git status and project structure at the start of every session, even though this information is already injected into the conversation context.

### Solution

This hook runs automatically when a new session begins:

1. **Clears the read cache** for the current session ID (if any leftover from a crashed session)
2. **Purges old caches** older than 7 days across all sessions
3. **Injects a reminder** telling Claude not to re-query session-injected state

```bash
# Cache cleanup
rm -rf "/tmp/claude-read-cache/$SESSION_ID"

# Purge stale caches (>7 days)
find "$CACHE_BASE" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} +
find /tmp/claude-hook-cache -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} +
```

### Result

```
[SessionStart] Read cache cleared (12 entries removed)

[Reminder] Do not re-query git status or project structure injected at session start.
```

Log output:
```
[14:30:01] session-start: done
```

## 2. pre-read.sh

**Event:** `PreToolUse` (matcher: `Read`)

### Problem

Claude Code frequently re-reads the same file multiple times in a single session:

- Before editing: reads the file to understand context
- After editing: reads it again to verify changes
- During review: reads it once more to check the result
- When referencing: reads it to answer questions about the code

A typical file gets read **3-5 times per session**. Each read consumes tokens proportional to the file size. For a 500-line file read 4 times, that's 2000 lines of tokens wasted on identical content.

Additionally, when Claude reads a very large file (1000+ lines), it consumes a massive amount of tokens even though it usually only needs a small section.

### Solution

This hook intercepts every `Read` tool call and applies three layers of protection:

#### Layer 1: Large File Blocking

Files exceeding 1000 lines are blocked entirely. Claude must specify `offset` and `limit` to read only the section it needs.

```bash
LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$FILE_PATH")
if [[ "$LINE_COUNT" -gt 1000 ]]; then
  echo "This file has ${LINE_COUNT} lines. Use offset/limit to read only the section you need."
  exit 2  # Block the read
fi
```

#### Layer 2: Cache Hit (Unchanged File)

If the file has been read before and hasn't changed since, the read is blocked entirely with a message telling Claude to use the content it already has.

```bash
if diff -q "$CACHE_FILE" "$FILE_PATH" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "File unchanged (re-read unnecessary): $FILE_PATH"
  exit 2  # Block the read
fi
```

#### Layer 3: Diff-Only Return (Changed File)

If the file has been read before but has changed (e.g., after an edit), only the diff is returned instead of the full file content.

```bash
diff --unified=3 "$CACHE_FILE" "$FILE_PATH"
cp "$FILE_PATH" "$CACHE_FILE"  # Update cache
exit 2  # Return diff instead of full read
```

#### Bypass Conditions

The hook does NOT intercept when:
- `offset` or `limit` is specified (partial read, already targeted)
- The file is binary or generated (`.png`, `.lock`, `.min.js`, etc.)
- The file has never been read before (first read always passes through)

### Result

**Case 1: Large file blocked**
```
This file has 2847 lines. Use offset/limit to read only the section you need.
```

**Case 2: Cache hit (file unchanged)**
```
File unchanged (re-read unnecessary): /project/src/auth/service.ts
No changes since last read. Work with the content you already have.
```

**Case 3: File changed since last read**
```
Showing only changes since last read: /project/src/auth/service.ts

## 3. post-file-cache.sh

**Event:** `PostToolUse` (matcher: `Read|Edit|Write`)

### Problem

The `pre-read.sh` hook needs a cached copy of each file to compare against. Without a caching mechanism, it has nothing to diff with. Additionally, when Claude edits or writes a file, the cache must be updated to stay in sync; otherwise, the next read would show a false diff.

### Solution

This hook runs after every `Read`, `Edit`, or `Write` tool call:

#### On Read (full file only)

Saves a snapshot of the file to the session-scoped cache directory. Partial reads (with `offset`/`limit`) are skipped since they don't represent the full file.

```bash
# Full read: cache the file
cp "$FILE_PATH" "$CACHE_FILE"
```

#### On Edit/Write

Updates the existing cache entry so it matches the new file state. Only updates if a cache entry already exists (doesn't create new entries on write).

```bash
if [[ "$IS_WRITE" == "true" ]]; then
  if [[ -f "$CACHE_FILE" ]]; then
    cp "$FILE_PATH" "$CACHE_FILE"  # Update existing cache
  fi
fi
```

#### Cache Key

Each file path is hashed (md5) to create a flat cache directory structure:

```
/tmp/claude-read-cache/{session_id}/{md5_of_filepath}
```

### Result

The hook is silent to Claude (no stdout output). It only writes to the log:

```
[14:31:10] post-file-cache: cached (service.ts)
[14:32:05] post-file-cache: cache updated (service.ts)
```

## 4. pre-bash.sh

**Event:** `PreToolUse` (matcher: `Bash`)

### Problem

**Test runners** produce verbose output. A typical `pytest` run with 100+ tests generates hundreds of lines, but Claude only needs:
- How many tests were collected
- Which tests failed (with tracebacks)
- The final summary

The rest (dots, passes, percentages, warnings) is noise that wastes tokens.

**Log commands** like `cat app.log` or `docker logs` can dump thousands of lines when only the recent entries matter.

### Solution

#### Test Runner Detection

The hook pattern-matches against common test commands:

```bash
# Matches: pytest, python -m pytest, manage.py test, npm test, npx jest, yarn test, vitest
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE '(pytest|python -m pytest|manage\.py test|npm test|npx jest|yarn test|vitest)'; then
```

When detected, it rewrites the command to pipe output through the `pre-bash.helper.filter.sh` awk filter:

```bash
# Original:  pytest tests/ -v
# Rewritten: pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | ~/.claude/hooks/pre-bash.helper.filter.sh
```

The rewrite is returned as a `hookSpecificOutput` JSON that Claude Code's hook system understands:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "updatedInput": { "command": "pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | /path/to/filter.sh" },
    "additionalContext": "Test output filtered (showing only: start, results, failures, errors)"
  }
}
```

#### Log Command Detection

Commands that read log files without any truncation (no `head`, `tail`, `grep`, etc.) are automatically piped through `tail -100`:

```bash
# Original:  cat /var/log/app.log
# Rewritten: cat /var/log/app.log | tail -100

# Original:  docker logs my-container
# Rewritten: docker logs my-container | tail -100
```

#### Passthrough

All other commands (e.g., `ls`, `git status`, `npm install`) pass through unchanged with `exit 0`.

### Result

**Test command (before):** 200+ lines of pytest output
**Test command (after):** ~8-15 lines (session start, failures, summary)

```
======================== test session starts ========================
collected 142 items
...
_______ FAILURES _______
___ test_payment_refund ___
assert result.status == "refunded"
AssertionError: assert "pending" == "refunded"
======================== 1 failed, 141 passed ========================
```

**Log command (before):** Entire log file (could be thousands of lines)
**Log command (after):** Last 100 lines only

Log output:
```
[14:33:10] pre-bash: test output filter applied
[14:34:22] pre-bash: log output limited to tail -100
```

## 5. pre-bash.helper.filter.sh

**Event:** None (helper script called by `pre-bash.sh`)

### Problem

Test runner output from different frameworks (pytest, jest, Django test, vitest) follows different formats. A single filter needs to handle all of them while extracting only the essential information.

### Solution

An `awk` script that uses a state machine (`pm` variable) to track which section of the output it's in:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `pm=0` | Normal (skip lines) | Only print known important patterns |
| `pm=1` | Test session header | Print until `collected N items`, then skip |
| `pm=2` | Failures / short summary | Print everything |
| `pm=3` | Errors section | Print everything |
| `pm=4` | Jest failure detail (`●`) | Print until blank line |

#### Patterns Always Printed (regardless of state)

| Pattern | Framework |
|---|---|
| `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `ERROR` | pytest |
| `Ran N tests`, `OK`, `FAILED (` | Django test |
| `Creating/Destroying test database` | Django test |
| `System check identified` | Django check |
| `Tests:`, `Test Suites:`, `PASS`, `FAIL` | Jest |
| `Traceback`, `Error:`, `assert` | All |

### Result

**pytest input (142 tests, 1 failure):**
```
======================== test session starts ========================

_______ FAILURES _______

## 6. post-compact.sh

**Event:** `PostCompact`

### Problem

When Claude Code's context window fills up, it triggers **compaction**: the conversation is summarized to free up space. After compaction, Claude loses the detailed content of files it previously read. However, the read cache still contains old snapshots, which means:

- `pre-read.sh` would incorrectly say "File unchanged" for files Claude no longer remembers
- Cached diffs would reference content Claude no longer has in context

The cache must be invalidated after compaction so Claude can re-read files fresh.

### Solution

This hook clears both cache directories for the current session:

```bash
# Clear read cache (file snapshots)
rm -rf "/tmp/claude-read-cache/$SESSION_ID"

# Clear hook cache (project context)
rm -rf "/tmp/claude-hook-cache/$SESSION_ID"
```

### Result

```
[PostCompact] Read cache cleared (24 entries removed). Re-read files as needed.
[PostCompact] Hook cache cleared.
```

After this, all subsequent `Read` calls pass through normally (first-read behavior), and the cache rebuilds naturally as Claude reads files again.

Log output:
```
[15:10:33] post-compact: read cache cleared (24 entries)
[15:10:33] post-compact: hook cache cleared
```

## Hook Lifecycle

A typical session flows through the hooks in this order:

```
Session Start
  │
  ├─ session-start.sh          Clear old cache, inject reminder
  │
  ├─ Read file.ts
  │   ├─ pre-read.sh           First read → pass through
  │   └─ post-file-cache.sh    Cache file snapshot
  │
  ├─ Read file.ts (again)
  │   └─ pre-read.sh           Cache hit → "File unchanged" (blocked)
  │
  ├─ Edit file.ts
  │   └─ post-file-cache.sh    Update cache with new content
  │
  ├─ Read file.ts (after edit)
  │   └─ pre-read.sh           Changed → return diff only
  │
  ├─ Bash: pytest tests/
  │   └─ pre-bash.sh           Rewrite with output filter
  │
  ├─ [Context compaction occurs]
  │   └─ post-compact.sh       Clear all caches
  │
  ├─ Read file.ts (after compaction)
  │   ├─ pre-read.sh           No cache → pass through (fresh read)
  │   └─ post-file-cache.sh    Re-cache file
  │
  └─ Session End
```
